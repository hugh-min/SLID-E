# *SLID-E: Slit Lamp Image Dataset for Epiphora - A Benchmark Resource for Automated Tear Overflow Analysis* 

*SLID-E (Slit Lamp Imaging Dataset for Epiphora) consists the first comprehensive dataset for epiphora grading using slit lamp photographs. The dataset comprises* *2,999* *high-quality images from 1,616 patients, annotated by expert ophthalmologists into four categories: normal, mild, moderate, and severe epiphora. The model achieved high accuracy on the validation set of 0.92-0.97 and maintained the performance on par with the test set (0.94-0.98), indicating good generalizability. SLID-E provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians, facilitating the development of automated diagnostic tools, standardization of grading criteria, and enhancement of telemedicine capabilities in ophthalmology.*
