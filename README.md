# *SLID-E: Slit Lamp Image Dataset for Epiphora - A Benchmark Resource for Automated Tear Overflow Analysis* 

*SLID-E (Slit Lamp Imaging Dataset for Epiphora) consists the first comprehensive dataset for epiphora grading using slit lamp photographs. The dataset comprises* *3,011* *high-quality images from 1,563 patients, annotated by expert ophthalmologists into four categories: normal, mild, moderate, and severe epiphora. This project demonstrates the dataset's utility through the development and evaluation of deep learning models for both image quality assessment and epiphora grading. These models achieved high accuracy in internal validation (up to 0.99) and maintained robust performance in external validation (0.95), indicating good generalizability. SLID-E provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians, facilitating the development of automated diagnostic tools, standardization of grading criteria, and enhancement of telemedicine capabilities in ophthalmology.*
